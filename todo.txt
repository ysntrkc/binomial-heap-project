1-) Get the keyword from the user use it as parameter 

2-) Open each files and read them until there is no more left
	-After reading each file search for keyword in that file and check how many times it appeared
	-Using this info create a node for that file and assign it to the array

3-) Create struct to resemblance each file add these attributes to the each struct(node):
	-File name (string)
	-Relevancy score (int)
	-Degree (int)
	-parent pointer (node)
	-sibling pointer (node)
	-child pointer (node)

4-)Create necessary methods

		• BH_Create()  – Creates the special header node for the BH.
		• BH_Find_Min() – Finds the minimum key in the BH.
		• BH_Merge(H1,H2) – Merges two BHs H1 and H2.
		• BH_Insert(H1,x)– Inserts x into H.
		• BH_Delete-Min(H) – Deletes the minimum key in H. 

5-) Create a max binomial heap considering the node's relevancy degree for now if have any time left then implement min  heap too

6-) extract 5 most relevant nodes and print their name out
